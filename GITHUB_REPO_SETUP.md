# IMPORTANT: Create GitHub Repository

Your repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet. You need to create it first.

## Two Options:

### OPTION A: Create via Web (Easiest - 1 minute)
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: esports-tournament-management-system
3. Description: Firebase-powered eSports Tournament Management System
4. Visibility: PUBLIC ← IMPORTANT!
5. Skip "Initialize this repository"
6. Click "Create repository"

Then come back and I'll push the code.

### OPTION B: Create via GitHub CLI (If installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:
```powershell
gh repo create esports-tournament-management-system --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

---

## After Creating Repository:

Run this command to push:
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

---

**WHICH OPTION DO YOU WANT?**
- Say "Created" when done with Option A (web)
- Or run Option B command if you have GitHub CLI

Then I'll complete the deployment!
